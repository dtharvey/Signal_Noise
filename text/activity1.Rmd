Noise is a problem for at least two reasons. First, if the noise overwhelms the signal, then the signal becomes invisible. Second, even if the signal is visible, any noise superimposed on the signal adds uncertainty to the signal.

#### How Do We Measure the Signal and the Noise?

The figure on the right shows a spectrum of a blue dye. The most common way to measure the signal, $S_\text{analyte}$, is to choose a wavelength that includes the signal and record the absorbance. The vertical line at 630 nm serves this purpose. The most common way to measure noise is to calculate the standard deviation, $s_\text{noise}$, over a range of wavelengths in which the signal's contribution is negligible. The rectangular box from 700--775 nm serves this purpose.

**Exercise 1**. Why is 630 nm an appropriate wavelength to use to measure the blue dye's absorbance? What problems, if any, arise if we use 500 nm or 600 nm?

**Exercise 2**.  Why is 700--775 nm an appropriate range of wavelengths to use to estimate the noise in this spectrum of blue dye? What problems, if any, arise if we use 600--650 nm or 800--900 nm?

#### How Do We Report the Signal and the Noise?

The spectrum on the right reports the signal and the noise as described above. The signal is always of interest to us as it provides information about the analyte's concentration. The absolute amount of noise usually is of little interest to us; however the amount of noise relative to the signal, called the signal-to-noise ratio, $S/N$, is important as it is a measurement of the uncertainty in the signal.
$$S/N = S_\text{analyte} / s_\text{noise}$$
**Exercise 3**. Use the slider to examine some or all of the 64 individual absorbance spectra in this data set. Pay attention to variations in the signal-to-noise ratios between spectra, all of which were obtained at the same time and under the same conditions. How much variation is there in the individual signal-to-noise ratio? What is its largest value? What is its smallest value? Are most values in the center of this range, or is the distribution more uniform?
