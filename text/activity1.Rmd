#### How Do We Measure the Analyte's Signal and the Noise?

The figure on the right shows one absorbance spectrum for a blue dye (the analyte). There is a peak near 630 nm, which is the analyte's signal; superimposed on this is noise from the process of measuring absorbance.

**Exercise 1**. To measure the analyte's signal, $S_\text{analyte}$, choose a wavelength using the signal slider and record the absorbance. Adjust the wavelength to find the signal's maximum value. Leave the wavelength unchanged and examine the variability of the analyte's signal by examining at least five additional spectra. Comment on your results. 

**Exercise 2**. To measure the noise we report the signal's standard deviation, $s_\text{noise}$, over a range of wavelengths where the analyte's contribution is negligible. Use the right-most slider to explore how $s_\text{noise}$ is affected by the location and width of the wavelength range. What is the best range of wavelengths for measuring the noise? Leaving the wavelength range unchanged, examine the variability of the noise for at least five of the other 64 spectra. Comment on your results. 

#### How Do We Report the Signal and the Noise?

The signal is always of interest as it provides information about the analyte's concentration. The absolute amount of noise is of less interest to us, but the amount of noise relative to the signal, the signal-to-noise ratio, $S/N$, is important as it provides a measurement of the signal's uncertainty.

$$S/N = S_\text{analyte} / s_\text{noise}$$

**Exercise 3**. Examine at least 10 of the individual absorbance spectra. Pay attention to variations in the signal-to-noise ratios between these spectra, all of which were obtained at the same time and under the same conditions. How much variation is there in the individual signal-to-noise ratios? Comment on your results.
