<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>The figure on
the right shows replicate visible spectra for a dilute solution of blue
dye. Each spectrum has the same <em>x</em>-axis and <em>y</em>-axis
scales, which are displayed in the lower right and the upper left
corners. Eight individual spectra are arranged on the outside (in light
blue); the central figure (in dark blue) overlays all 64 spectra. Each
spectrum has two parts: a determinate, or systematic contribution from
the blue dye and an indeterminate, or random contribution from
uncertainty in the measurement process. The first is the signal and the
second is the noise.</p>
<div id="examining-the-signal" class="section level4">
<h4>Examining the Signal</h4>
<p>Each individual spectrum has a prominent absorbance peak that is
roughly symmetric in shape and has a similar position, height, and
width. The similarity in these features suggests that a spectrum
contains useful information about the blue dye in the form of the
position, shape, height, and width of its peak. Any additional spectra
should share these features. This is what it means to say that a
spectrum includes a systematic signal.</p>
</div>
<div id="examining-the-noise" class="section level4">
<h4>Examining the Noise</h4>
<p>The individual spectra also shares a background absorbance on either
side of the peak that fluctuates in value. These fluctuations are random
and do not share a systematic pattern that carries information about the
blue dye; the fluctuations do, however, carry information about the
spectrometer used to record these spectra. Any additional spectra of the
blue dye should share these features. This is what it means to say that
a spectrum contains noise.</p>

<h4>Examining the Signal and the Noise</h4>
<p>The central image—which is an overlay of all 64 spectra—gives
additional insight to the difference between the signal and the noise.
The peak in the overlaid spectra retains the shape, position, and height
of the individual spectra; the variation in the noise, however, is
evident in the thickness of the trace.</p>
