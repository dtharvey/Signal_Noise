<p>The Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that takes a
signal in one measurement domain and converts it into a complimentary
signal in another measurement domain. Although the mathematics behind a
Fourier transform are complex, it is easy to appreciate why such a
transformation is possible. Consider a sine wave with an amplitude of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a frequency of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. A plot of amplitude vs time shows an
oscillating sine wave in the time domain. A plot of amplitude vs
frequency, however, shows the sine wave in the frequency domain as a
single line with an amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
at a frequency of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Both domains
are defined by the sine waveâ€™s amplitude and frequency.</p>

<h4>Fourier Filtering</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is the frequency domain spectrum of a
blue dye. The spectrum has 512 points with the signal measured at 630 nm
and the noise measured from 725 nm to 750 nm. A Fourier transform of
this data gives the time domain spectrum on the bottom right, which also
has 512 points. In the time domain spectrum, information about the
signal is carried mostly by the points at the far left and the far
right, and information about the noise is carried mostly by the points
in the center. In Fourier filtering we assign an amplitude of zero to
those points in the time domain that primarily represent noise and use
an inverse Fourier transform to return to the frequency domain.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong> The figure on the upper right is
described as a frequency domain spectrum. The <em>x</em>-axis, however,
is defined using wavelengths instead of frequencies. Why is this
okay?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> The right-most slider sets the number of
points to retain in the time domain spectrum and, therefore, the number
of points to filter out. Adjust the slider to retain 256 points. Which
points are retained and which points are filtered out? Did this
filtering improve the signal-to-noise ratio?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Repeat Exercise 1, using the slider to
retain, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 points. What happens to the
signal-to-noise ratio as you successively cut in half the number of
points to retain. How many points do you need to retain to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio? If your goal is to determine the wavelength with
the maximum absorbance, what is the smallest number of points you need
to retain?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Repeat Exercise 3 using at least five
additional spectra and comment on your results.</p>
