<p>The Fourier transform (FT) is a mathematical operation that takes a
signal in one measurement domain and converts it into a complimentary
signal in another measurement domain. Although the mathematics behind a
FT are complex, it is easy to appreciate why this transformation is
possible. Consider a single sine wave with an amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and a frequency of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. A plot of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> shows the sine wave in the time domain.
A plot of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> gives the frequency domain as a single
vertical line with an amplitude of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at a frequency of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Fourier Filtering</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is the frequency domain spectrum of a
blue dye. The spectrum has 512 points with the signal measured at 630 nm
and the noise measured from 725 nm to 750 nm. A Fourier transform gives
the time domain spectrum on the bottom right, which also has 512 points.
In the time domain spectrum, information about the signal is carried
mostly by the points at the far left and the far right, and information
about the noise is carried mostly by the points in the center. In
Fourier filtering we assign an amplitude of zero to those points in the
time domain that primarily represent noise and use an inverse Fourier
transform to return to the frequency domain.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong> The right-most slider sets the number of
points to retain in the time domain spectrum and, therefore, the number
of points to filter out. Adjust the slider to retain 256 points. Which
points are retained and which points are filtered out? Did this
filtering improve the signal-to-noise ratio?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Repeat Exercise 1, using the slider to
retain 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 points. What happens to the
signal-to-noise ratio as you successively cut in half the number of
points to retain. How many points do you need to retain to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio? If your goal is to determine the wavelength with
the maximum absorbance, what is the smallest number of points you need
to retain?</p>
