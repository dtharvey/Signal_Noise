<h4>Details on the Data Set Used in this Module</h4>
<p>The spectra in all activities, except for Activity 2, use a
commercial blue food coloring that contains the FD&amp;C dyes Blue 1 and
Red 40. To allow for small signal-to-noise ratios, a portion of the
stock solution was diluted until the absorbance was between 0.02 and
0.03 au. Spectra were recorded using a Vernier SpectroVis Plus
spectrometer and LoggerPro software. A full spectrum was recorded from
450 nm to 899.8 nm for each of 70+ consecutive scans, which were stored
and exported as a single .csv file. This file was then trimmed to the
first 64 spectra for use in this module. You can use the download button
to retrieve the spectra as a .csv file; the individual spectra are
organized in columns of absorbance values at 560 wavelengths, whose
values are in the first column.</p>

<div id="preparing-the-data-for-fourier-filtering" class="section level4">
<h4>Preparing the Data for Fourier Filtering</h4>
<p>For reasons we will not consider here, the number of points in the
frequency domain and the time domain for Fourier filtering must be a
power of 2. As <span class="math inline">\(2^{9} = 512\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(2^{10} = 1024\)</span>, the spectra for this
activity use only the first 512 wavelengths, spanning a wavelength range
of 450 nm to 857.6 nm.</p>

<div id="why-did-we-use-synthetic-data-in-activity-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Why Did We Use Synthetic Data in Activity 2?</h4>
<p>One limitation to working with real spectra is that we cannot
separate the signal from the noise so that we can examine them
separately, Synthetic data allows us to do this by separately creating
the signal and the noise, and then adding them together to create a
noisy signal. The figure on the upper right shows the original spectrum
from Activity 2 as the pure signal (bottom), the pure noise (middle),
and the resulting noisy signal (top).</p>

<div id="can-we-use-a-smoothing-filter-several-times-on-the-same-data" class="section level4">
<h4>Can We Use a Smoothing Filter Several Times on the Same Data?</h4>
<p>In a word: yes. The figure on the lower right shows, in blue, one
spectrum of the blue dye and the results, in magenta, of applying a
15-point moving average filter 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 times. As with any
filter, care is needed to avoid distortions due to over-smoothing.</p>
