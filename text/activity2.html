<p>The signal-to-noise ratio affects our ability to answer the question
at the heart of many analytical methods: Is the analyte present, and, if
yes, at what concentration? The figure to the right shows a noisy signal
that has one peak. The specific source of the data is not important;
indeed, this is synthetic data. The signal, the noise, and the
signal-to-noise ratio are listed above the figure. The two sliders allow
you to increase or decrease the contribution of the signal and the
noise. A multiplier of 1.5 for the signal increases its value by a
factor of <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times\)</span>, and a
multiplier of 0.5 for the noise decreases its contribution by a factor
of <span class="math inline">\(0.5 \times\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Qualitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
<p>A qualitative judgement is a binary decision: are you confident—yes
or no—that the analyte is present?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Use the two sliders to identify a
threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that a
peak is present. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by
beginning with a larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?</p>

<h4>Quantitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
<p>For a quantitative judgement we want to minimize any uncertainty in
the signal’s value.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Use the two sliders to identify a
threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that the
noise does not significantly affect your measurement of the the signal’s
value. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by beginning with a
larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. How does your qualitative threshold
compare to your quantitative threshold? Are they relatively similar to
each other, or are they quite different? Are you comfortable with this
difference?</p>
