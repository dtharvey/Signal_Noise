<p>The signal-to-noise ratio affects our ability to answer two questions
at the heart of many analytical measurements: Is the analyte present,
and, if yes, at what concentration? The figure to the right shows an
analytical measurement that yields a peak. The specific source of the
data is not important; indeed, this is purely synthetic data. The
signal, the noise, and the signal-to-noise ratio are reported above the
figure; this is the default spectrum. The two sliders allow you to
increase or to decrease the contribution of the signal and the noise,
and thus, to vary the signal-to-noise ratio. A multiplier of 1.5 for the
signal increases the signal by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times\)</span>, and a multiplier of 0.5 for
the noise decreases the noise by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(0.5 \times\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Qualitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
<p>A qualitative judgement is a binary decision: are you confident—yes
or no—that the analyte is present?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Use the two sliders to identify a
threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that a
peak is present. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by
beginning with a larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?</p>

<h4>Quantitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h4>
<p>For a quantitative judgement you want to minimize any uncertainty in
your measurement of the signal’s value.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Use the two sliders to identify a
threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that the
noise does not significantly affect your measurement of the the signal’s
value. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by beginning with a
larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. How does your qualitative threshold
compare to your quantitative threshold? Are they relatively similar to
each other, or are they quite different? Are you comfortable with this
difference?</p>
