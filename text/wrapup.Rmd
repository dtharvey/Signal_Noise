#### Details on the Data Set Used in this Learning Module

The spectra in all exercises in this learning module, except for those on the "Evaluating the Signal-to-Noise Ratio tab, use a commercial blue food coloring that contains the FD&C dyes Blue 1 and Red 40. To allow for small signal-to-noise ratios, a portion of the stock solution was diluted until its absorbance was between 0.02 and 0.03 absorbance units. Spectra were recorded using a Vernier SpectroVis Plus spectrometer and LoggerPro software. A full spectrum was recorded from 450 nm to 899.8 nm for each of 70+ consecutive scans and exported as a single .csv file. This file was then trimmed to the first 64 spectra. You can use the download button to retrieve the spectra as a .csv file; the individual spectra are organized in columns of absorbance values at 560 wavelengths, whose values are in the first column.

#### Preparing the Data for Fourier Filtering

For reasons we will not consider here, the number of points in the frequency domain and the time domain for Fourier filtering must be a power of 2. As $2^{9} = 512$ and $2^{10} = 1024$, the spectra for this activity use only the first 512 wavelengths, spanning a wavelength range of 450 nm to 857.6 nm.

#### Why Is Synthetic Data Used for the "Evaluating the Signal-to-Noise Tab"?

One limitation to working with real spectra is that we cannot separate the signal from the noise so that we can examine them separately, Synthetic data allows us to do this by separately creating the signal and the noise, and then adding them together to create a noisy signal. The figure on the upper right shows the original spectrum from the "Evaluating the Signal-to-Noise" tab as the pure signal (bottom), the pure noise (middle), and the resulting noisy signal (top).

#### Can We Use a Smoothing Filter Several Times on the Same Data?

In a word: yes. The figure on the lower right shows, in blue, one spectrum of the blue dye and the results, in magenta, of applying a 15-point moving average filter 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 times. As with any filter, care is needed to avoid distortions due to over-smoothing.

#### Additional Resources

You can learn more about signals, noise, signal-to-noise ratios, and signal averaging in [Chapter 10.3 of *Analytical Chemistry 2.1*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)/10%3A_Spectroscopic_Methods/10.03%3A_UV_Vis_and_IR_Spectroscopy). You can learn more about signal averaging, smoothing filters, and Fourier filtering---including examples of R code for cleaning up data---in [Chapter 10 of *Chemometrics with R*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Chemometrics_Using_R_(Harvey)/10%3A_Cleaning_Up_Data). Both of these resources are part of the [LibreText](https://libretexts.org/) project.

The following papers provide a good introduction to the Fourier transform and its application in spectroscopy. The last of these papers describes a Python-based interactive learning module.
