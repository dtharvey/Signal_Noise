<p>Signal averaging works well when the time to record a single spectrum
is short and when the sample and the instrument are stable with respect
to time. If either condition fails, we can take advantage of the fact
that noise changes quickly while the signal changes more slowly, and
smooth the noise by averaging it across several adjacent points.</p>
<div id="moving-average-smoothing-filter" class="section level4">
<h4>Moving Average Smoothing Filter</h4>
<p>In a moving average filter we add together an odd number of
consecutive points from a spectrum (the filter’s length), average their
values, and replace the filter’s middle point with this average. Use the
controls on the right to explore how the length of a moving average
filter affects the signal-to-noise ratio by experimenting with several
of the available 64 spectra of blue dye. The signal is measured at 630
nm and the noise is measured between 725 nm and 775 nm. The magenta
trace is the original data and the dark blue trace is the data after
smoothing.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Think about what it means to take an
average and explain why averaging five consecutive points from a noisy
spectrum will reduce the noise more than the signal. Why does the filter
use an odd number of data points?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. As you increase the width of the moving
average filter you should notice that the smoothed spectrum has lost
points at both smaller and large wavelengths. Explain why this
distortion of the original spectrum is expected.</p>

<div id="savitzky-golay-smoothing-filter" class="section level4">
<h4>Savitzky-Golay Smoothing Filter</h4>
<p>A moving average filter treats all points equally. With a
Savitzky-Golay filter, we assign more weight to points near the middle
of the filter than we do to points at the filter’s edges. The signal is
measured at 630 nm and the noise is measured between 725 nm and 775 nm.
The magenta trace is the original data and the dark blue trace is the
data after smoothing.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Use the controls on the right to explore
how the length of a Savitzky-Golay filter affects the signal-to-noise
ratio by experimenting with several of the available 64 spectra of blue
dye.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Compare equally-sized moving average
filters and Savitzky-Golay filters to each other. What advantages are
apparent with a moving average filter? What advantages are apparent with
a Savitzky-Golay filter?</p>
