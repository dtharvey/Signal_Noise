The signal-to-noise ratio affects our ability to answer the question at the heart of many analytical methods: Is the analyte present, and, if yes, at what concentration? The figure to the right shows a noisy signal that has one peak. The specific source of the data is not important; indeed, this is synthetic data. The signal, the noise, and the signal-to-noise ratio are listed above the figure. The two sliders allow you to increase or decrease the contribution of the signal and the noise. A multiplier of 1.5 for the signal increases its value by a factor of $1.5 \times$, and a multiplier of 0.5 for the noise decreases its contribution by a factor of $0.5 \times$.

#### Qualitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio

A qualitative judgement is a binary decision: are you confident---yes or no---that the analyte is present?

**Exercise 1**. Use the two sliders to identify a threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that a peak is present. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by beginning with a larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?

#### Quantitative Judgements Using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio

For a quantitative judgement we want to minimize any uncertainty in the signal's value.

**Exercise 2**. Use the two sliders to identify a threshold signal-to-noise ratio above which you are confident that the noise does not significantly affect your measurement of the the signal's value. Is your threshold the same if you approach it by beginning with a larger or a smaller signal-to-noise ratio?

**Exercise 3**. How does your qualitative threshold compare to your quantitative threshold? Are they relatively similar to each other, or are they quite different? Are you comfortable with this difference?
