When the signal-to-noise ratio is insufficient for your purpose, there are two broad strategies you can use to improve its value: hardware solutions and software solutions. Hardware solutions are built into the instrument and are not of interest here. With a software, or computational, solution, we mathematically process the data as it is collected or after data collection is complete. 

#### Signal Averaging

The simplest computational approach is to average a set of $n$ individual spectra Because the analyte's signal is the same for each spectrum, its value increases linearly with $n$; noise, however, is random and increases as the square root of $n$; thus
$$\left( S_\text{analyte} \right)_n = n \times S_\text{analyte} \text{ and } \left( s_\text{noise} \right)_n = \sqrt{n} \times s_\text{noise}$$
**Exercise 1**. Given these two equations, derive an equation that expresses the signal-to-noise ratio after $n$ scans, $\left( S/N \right)_n$, as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio after one scan, $\left( S/N \right)_1$, and the number of scans, $n$. What will a plot of $\left( S/N \right)_n$ as a function of $n$ look like?

**Exercise 2**. Suppose a single scan has a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0. What is the signal-to-noise ratio if $n = 4$? How many spectra do you need to average together to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.0? 

**Exercise 3**. The figure on the right shows, in the center and in light blue, a single absorbance spectrum of dilute blue food coloring; this sample has a $S/N$ ratio close to the average for the 64 spectra in the data set. This spectrum is surrounded by eight spectra, in dark blue, obtained by averaging together $n$ spectra, where $n$ is set by the slider. Each set of $n$ spectra is selected at random from the set of 64 spectra. Use the slider to explore the effect of $n$ on the signal-to-noise ratio, comparing your experimental results to your expectations. To maintain a constant $y$-axis scale, each spectrum is divided by $n$ before determining $S_\text{analyte}$, and $s_\text{noise}$.

**Question 4**. The equation for the signal-to-noise ratio assumes noise increases as the square root of *n*, which is true only if its mean and standard deviation are independent of time and of the signal's magnitude; when either is not true, then the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio falls short of its expected value. What does this tell you about this set of 64 spectra?
