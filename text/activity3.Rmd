When the signal-to-noise ratio is too small there are two broad strategies we can use to increase its value: hardware solutions and software solutions. Hardware solutions are built into the instrument and are not of interest here. With a software solution, we process the data using a mathematical algorithm as it is collected or after data collection is complete.

#### Signal Averaging

The simplest software approach is to average a set of $n$ individual spectra. Because the analyte's signal is nominally the same for each spectrum, its value increases linearly with $n$; noise, however, is random and increases as the square root of $n$; thus
$$\left( S_\text{analyte} \right)_n = n \times S_\text{analyte} \quad \quad \quad \left( s_\text{noise} \right)_n = \sqrt{n} \times s_\text{noise}$$
**Exercise 1**. Given these equations, derive an equation that expresses the signal-to-noise ratio after $n$ scans, $(S/N)_n$, as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio for one scan, $(S/N)_1$, and the number of scans, $n$. What does a plot of $(S/N)_n$ as a function of $n$ look like? Suppose a single scan has a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0. What is the signal-to-noise ratio if $n = 4$? What value of $n$ will yield a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.0? 

**Exercise 2**. The figure on the right shows, in the center, a single absorbance spectrum of dilute blue dye. Surrounding this spectrum are eight spectra obtained by averaging together $n$ spectra, where $n$ is set by the slider. Explore the effect of $n$ on the signal-to-noise ratio, comparing your results to your expectations. To maintain a constant $y$-axis scale, each spectrum is divided by $n$ before determining $S_\text{analyte}$, and $s_\text{noise}$.

**Exercise 3**. The equation for the signal-to-noise ratio assumes noise increases as the square root of *n*, which is true only if its mean and its standard deviation are independent of time and independent of the signal's magnitude; if either is not true, then the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio falls short of its expected value. What does this tell you about this set of 64 spectra?
