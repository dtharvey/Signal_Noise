<h4>How Do We Measure the Analyte’s Signal and the Noise?</h4>
<p>The figure on the right is an absorbance spectrum for a blue dye,
which is our analyte. There is a peak between 500 nm and 700 nm, which
is the analyte’s signal. Superimposed on the analyte’s signal is noise
from the process of measuring absorbance.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. To measure the analyte’s signal, <span class="math inline">\(S_\text{analyte}\)</span>, we choose a wavelength
and record the absorbance. The vertical magenta line labeled signal is
the wavelength used to report the analyte’s signal, which appears on the
right-side of the figure. Use the middle slider to find the wavelength
where the analyte’s signal has its maximum value. Leaving the wavelength
unchanged, examine the variability of the analyte’s signal for at least
five additional spectra and comment on your results.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. To measure the noise we calculate the
signal’s standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(s_\text{noise}\)</span>, using a range of
wavelengths where the analyte’s contribution is negligible. The
horizontal green line shows the range of wavelengths used to report the
noise, which appears on the right-side of the figure. Use the left-most
slider to pick a spectrum and set the wavelength to the value used in
the previous exercise. Use the right-most slider to explore how <span class="math inline">\(s_\text{noise}\)</span> is affected by the
location and width of the wavelength range. What is the best range of
wavelengths for measuring the noise? Leaving the wavelength range
unchanged, examine the variability of the noise for at least five of the
other 64 spectra and comment on your results.</p>

<h4>How Do We Report the Signal and the Noise?</h4>
<p>The signal is always of interest to us as it provides information
about the analyte’s concentration. The absolute amount of noise is of
less interest to us; however the amount of noise relative to the signal,
the signal-to-noise ratio, <span class="math inline">\(S/N\)</span>, is
important as it is a measurement of the signal’s uncertainty.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S/N = S_\text{analyte} /
s_\text{noise}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Use the slider to examine some of the 64
individual absorbance spectra in this data set. Pay attention to
variations in the signal-to-noise ratios between spectra, all of which
were obtained at the same time and under the same conditions. How much
variation is there in the individual signal-to-noise ratios? Comment on
your results.</p>
