<h4>How Do We Measure the Analyte’s Signal and the Noise?</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows one absorbance spectrum for a blue dye
(the analyte). There is a peak near 630 nm, which is the analyte’s
signal; superimposed on this is noise from the process of measuring
absorbance.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. To measure the analyte’s signal, <span class="math inline">\(S_\text{analyte}\)</span>, choose a wavelength
using the signal slider and record the absorbance. Adjust the wavelength
to find the signal’s maximum value. Leave the wavelength unchanged and
examine the variability of the analyte’s signal by examining at least
five additional spectra. Comment on your results.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. To measure the noise we report the
signal’s standard deviation, <span class="math inline">\(s_\text{noise}\)</span>, over a range of
wavelengths where the analyte’s contribution is negligible. Use the
right-most slider to explore how <span class="math inline">\(s_\text{noise}\)</span> is affected by the
location and width of the wavelength range. What is the best range of
wavelengths for measuring the noise? Leaving the wavelength range
unchanged, examine the variability of the noise for at least five of the
other 64 spectra. Comment on your results.</p>

<h4>How Do We Report the Signal and the Noise?</h4>
<p>The signal is always of interest as it provides information about the
analyte’s concentration. The absolute amount of noise is of less
interest to us, but the amount of noise relative to the signal, the
signal-to-noise ratio, <span class="math inline">\(S/N\)</span>, is
important as it provides a measurement of the signal’s uncertainty.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S/N = S_\text{analyte} /
s_\text{noise}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. Examine at least 10 of the individual
absorbance spectra. Pay attention to variations in the signal-to-noise
ratios between these spectra, all of which were obtained at the same
time and under the same conditions. How much variation is there in the
individual signal-to-noise ratios? Comment on your results.</p>
