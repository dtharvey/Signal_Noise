<p>When the signal-to-noise ratio is too small there are two broad
strategies we can use to increase its value: hardware solutions and
software solutions. Hardware solutions are built into the instrument and
are not of interest here. With a software solution, we process the data
using a mathematical algorithm as it is collected or after data
collection is complete.</p>
<div id="signal-averaging" class="section level4">
<h4>Signal Averaging</h4>
<p>The simplest software approach is to average a set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> individual spectra. Because the
analyte’s signal is nominally the same for each spectrum, its value
increases linearly with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>; noise,
however, is random and increases as the square root of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>; thus <span class="math display">\[\left( S_\text{analyte} \right)_n = n \times
S_\text{analyte} \quad \quad \quad \left( s_\text{noise} \right)_n =
\sqrt{n} \times s_\text{noise}\]</span> <strong>Exercise 1</strong>.
Given these equations, derive an equation that expresses the
signal-to-noise ratio after <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
scans, <span class="math inline">\((S/N)_n\)</span>, as a function of
the signal-to-noise ratio for one scan, <span class="math inline">\((S/N)_1\)</span>, and the number of scans, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. What does a plot of <span class="math inline">\((S/N)_n\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> look like? Suppose a single scan has a
signal-to-noise ratio of 1.0. What is the signal-to-noise ratio if <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>? What value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> will yield a signal-to-noise ratio of
4.0?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. The figure on the right shows, in the
center, a single absorbance spectrum of dilute blue dye. Surrounding
this spectrum are eight spectra obtained by averaging together <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> spectra, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is set by the slider. Explore the
effect of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> on the signal-to-noise
ratio, comparing your results to your expectations. To maintain a
constant <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis scale, each
spectrum is divided by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> before
determining <span class="math inline">\(S_\text{analyte}\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(s_\text{noise}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. The equation for the signal-to-noise
ratio assumes noise increases as the square root of <em>n</em>, which is
true only if its mean and its standard deviation are independent of time
and independent of the signal’s magnitude; if either is not true, then
the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio falls short of its expected
value. What does this tell you about this set of 64 spectra?</p>
